This repository serves as a showcase for the projects highlighted in my resume. Please note that this is not an active development repository; it is solely intended for demonstration purposes. Each project is briefly described below.

### Australian Wildfire Segmentation in Satellites – M.IT. Thesis (Python) ###
Conducted research for M.IT. Thesis, focusing on Australian wildfire segmentation in satellite imagery within resource- constrained environments, simulating NanoSats hosting the segmentation process. Implemented ResNet, UNet, Xception, and DeepLabV3+ as backbone-architecture pairs, exploring techniques such as transfer learning, fine-tuning, and model compression.


### Autonomous Agents Playing Yinsh (Python) (Team Project) ###
Collaborated on a team project to develop autonomous agents capable of playing Yinsh, utilizing blind search, heuristic search, Monte Carlo tree search, and Minimax Tree search for optimal move selection.


### Authorship Attribution (Python) (Team Project) ###
Contributed to a team project involving authorship attribution of short texts using categorical embedding. Explored methods including Random Forests, ensemble techniques with a neural network meta-classifier, and Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier.


### Examining the Effect of Unlabelled Tweet Data on Twitter Sentiment Classification (Python) ###
Investigated the impact of incorporating unlabelled Tweet data on sentiment classification using Gaussian Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression semi-supervised classifiers, comparing results against a supervised classifier.

### Treasure Hunt Game using OOP (Java) ### 
Excluded as no report was wrtitten
